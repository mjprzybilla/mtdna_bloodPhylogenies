This repository was created to store and provide all scripts used in the rotation project "Assessing the somatic heritability of mitochondrial copy number in large somatic phylogenies". This includes the scripts for generation of all figures and for the analyses implemented. 

It should be noted that the scripts for the generation and analysis of the underlying blood phylogenies are not excluded here, but can be found at the respective Github pages accompanying the manuscripts by *Spencer-Chapman et al.* [https://github.com/mspencerchapman/Phylogeny_of_foetal_haematopoiesis] and *Mitchell et al.*.
